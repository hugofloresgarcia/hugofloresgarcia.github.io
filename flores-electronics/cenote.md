## description

`cenote` is a frequency-shifting chorus/delay and vibrato pedal. It combines a delay with a frequency shifter and a vibrato effect, allowing you to create swirling, spiraling sounds that can be used in a variety of musical contexts.

`cenote` is based on the OP-1's `cwo` effect, a frequency-shifting delay designed by Magnus Lidstr√∂m. unlike the `cwo`,  `cenote` features 4 toggle switches that create a variety of swirls and spirals when played with in a performative manner. plug the `cenote` after a looper, and play with the knobs and switches to create all kinds of textures!

## for nerds

On the inside, Cenote uses an [Electrosmith Daisy](https://electrosmith.com/) microcontroller as the brains, and a [PedalPCB Terrarium](https://www.pedalpcb.com/product/pcb351/) as the hardware platform.

The code is open source! you can build one yourself or hack it yourself! see https://github.com/hugofloresgarcia/terrarium-pedals/tree/main/cenote
