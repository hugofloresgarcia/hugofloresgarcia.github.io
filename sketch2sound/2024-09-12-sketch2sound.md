Sketch2Sound is a generative sound synthesizer capable of creating high-quality sounds from a set of interpretable time-varying control signals: loudness, brightness, and pitch, as well as text prompts. Sketch2Sound can synthesize arbitrary sounds from sonic imitations (i.e., a vocal imitation or a reference sound-shape).
