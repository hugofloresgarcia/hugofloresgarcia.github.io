hi friends!! :) 

i will be defending my phd dissertation next week!

the defense is open to the public, so please come hang and hear me chat about artist centered and expressive machine learning for the sound arts :)

**talk title**: The Neural Tape Loop: Controllable and Expressive Generative Modelling for the Sound Arts

**abstract**:
State-of-the-art generative audio models rely on text prompting mechanisms as a primary form of interaction with users. While text prompting can be a powerful supplement to more gestural interfaces, a sound is worth more than a thousand words: sonic structures like a syncopated rhythm or the timbral morphology of a moving texture are hard to describe in text. They can be more easily described through a sonic gesture. I describe two technical research works exploring generative audio modeling with gestural and interactive control mechanisms: VampNet (via masked acoustic token modeling) and Sketch2Sound (via fine-grained interpretable control signals). I introduce the neural tape loop: a co-creative generative musical meta-instrument for experimental music and sound art designed and developed using practice-based research methods. I propose new interactive sound manipulation techniques based on the affordances of masked acoustic token models, and illustrate the musical capabilities of these techniques through four original creative works (a composed improvisation, two fixed media electroacoustic pieces, and a multichannel interactive sound installation) made in collaboration with sound artists, composers, and instrumentalists. Finally, I reflect on how engaging in a mixed creative and technical research practice can be a catalyst for culturally situated and artist-centered innovation and advancement in generative musical instrument design.
