## [Deep Learning Tools for Audacity](https://interactiveaudiolab.github.io/project/audacity.html)

We provide a software framework that lets deep learning practitioners easily integrate their own PyTorch models into the open-source Audacity DAW. This lets ML audio researchers put tools in the hands of sound artists without doing DAW-specific development work.

## [Leveraging Hierarchical Structures for Few-Shot Musical Instrument Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07029)
In this work, we exploit hierarchical relationships between instruments in a few-shot learning setup to enable classification of a wider set of musical instruments, given a few examples at inference. See the [supplementary code](https://github.com/hugofloresgarcia/music-trees) on github. 

# Software

## [Audacity with Deep Learning](https://interactiveaudiolab.github.io/project/audacity.html)
I am contributing a deep learning framework and a deep model manager that connects to HuggingFace to Audacity. This project was funded by a [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2021/projects/5097817919455232/) grant. Read the [Work Product Summary](https://www.audacityteam.org/gsoc-2021-work-product-source-separation-and-deep-learning-tools/).

## [`audacitorch`](https://github.com/hugofloresgarcia/audacitorch)
PyTorch wrappers for using your deep model in Audacity, and sharing it with the community!

## [`torchopenl3`](https://github.com/hugofloresgarcia/torchopenl3)
A PyTorch port of the openl3 audio embedding (ported from the [marl](https://github.com/marl/openl3) implementation). 

## [Philharmonia Dataset](https://github.com/hugofloresgarcia/philharmonia-dataset)
PyTorch dataset bindings for 14,000 sound samples of the Philharmonia Orchestra, retrieved from their website.
