Hi! 

My name is Hugo Flores García. I’m a PhD candidate at Northwestern University working under [Bryan Pardo](http://www.bryanpardo.com/) in the [Interactive Audio Lab](https://interactiveaudiolab.github.io). I perform research at the intersection of machine learning, music, and human computer interaction, and I'm interested in building interfaces for musical expression, powered by deep learning. I was born and raised in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, but now live in Chicago, IL. In my spare time, I enjoy playing guitar, hanging out with my cat Pippi, and making audiovisual art :).
