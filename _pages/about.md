Hi! 

My name is Hugo Flores García. Born and raised in Honduras, I’m a doctoral student at Northwestern University, working under [Bryan Pardo](http://www.bryanpardo.com/) in the [Interactive Audio Lab](https://interactiveaudiolab.github.io). 
I perform research at the intersection of machine learning, music, and human computer interaction. My interests include sound event detection, audio source separation, and designing interfaces for inclusive music creation. 
In my spare time, I enjoy playing guitar, hanging out with my cat pippi, and making audiovisual art :).
