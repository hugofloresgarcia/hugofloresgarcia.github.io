title: Deep Learning Tools for Audacity
---

[Aldo Aguilar](https://aldo-aguilar.github.io/), [Ethan Manilow](https://ethman.github.io/) and I made a software framework that lets deep learning practitioners easily integrate their own PyTorch models into [Audacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audacity_(audio_editor)). This lets ML audio researchers put tools in the hands of sound artists without doing DAW-specific development work, which is often a long and arduous process in itself.
