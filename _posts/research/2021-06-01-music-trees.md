In this work, we exploit hierarchical relationships between instruments in a few-shot learning setup to enable classification of a wider set of musical instruments, given a few examples at inference. See the [supplementary code](https://github.com/hugofloresgarcia/music-trees) on github. 

**update**: this work won the Best Paper Award at ISMIR 2021! :)
