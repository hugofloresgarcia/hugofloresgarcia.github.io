Led by my labmate Patrick O'Reilly, TRIA (The Rhythm In Anything), takes as input two audio prompts -- one specifying the desired drum timbre, and one specifying the desired rhythm -- and synthesizes drum beats that follow the rhythm prompt, while keeping the timbre prompt (i.e. playing the desired rhythm with the desired timbre).
