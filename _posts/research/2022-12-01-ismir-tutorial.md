[Yu Wang](https://y-wang.weebly.com/), [Jeong Choi](https://jeongchoi.home.blog/) and I gave a tutorial during ISMIR 2022 on few-shot and zero-shot learning centered around music information retrieval tasks. 
In this tutorial, we cover the foundations of few-shot//zero-shot learning, build standalone coding examples, and discuss the state-of-the-art in the field, as well as future directions. 

The tutorial is available as a jupyter book [online](https://music-fsl-zsl.github.io/tutorial/landing.html).
