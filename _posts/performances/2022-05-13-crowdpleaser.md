a solo improvised, electronic set at the crowdpleaser (evanston, IL, may 2022)

I played a quick set of improvised music with drum loops, synthesizers and electric guitar at the crowdpleaser in Evanston, IL. one of the best tunes was my own rendition of "I love parmesan cheese", a sound that was trending on tiktok at the time.
