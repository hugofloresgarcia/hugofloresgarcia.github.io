`unloop` is the musical interface that accompanies [VampNet](/research), which is a generative model for music I published at ISMIR 2023. `unloop` is a looper that uses generative modeling to **not** repeat itself. `unloop` can generate variations of loop a musician has recorded, creating a more interactive and fun experience than using a traditional looper. `unloop` is [open source](https://github.com/hugofloresgarcia/unloop), and has a [demo video](https://www.notion.so/hugo-does-things/unloop-a-looper-that-doesn-t-repeat-itself-a32a2bcadb264a82abf235d44c48a225)
