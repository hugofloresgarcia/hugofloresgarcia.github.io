Pedalboy was my last assignment in undergrad, and it was a lot of fun to make. I made it for [Dr. John Thompson's](www.timebent.com) SuperCollider class. Pedalboy is a SuperCollider pedalboard with lots of lfos, lower-level controls, and midi support. Look at the code [here](https://github.com/hugofloresgarcia/pedalboy).
