Automaton is a cellular automata sequencer built using SuperCollider. You play with automaton by clicking around the grid, spawning new cells that then go on and live their life. Each cell triggers a note or a grain. Try it and and look at the code [here](https://github.com/hugofloresgarcia/automaton).
