The cloudchoir is half theremin // half four-part choir. With one hand, you can move the pitch of each voice independently, in half steps. With the other hand, you control the dynamics and expressivity of the choir. Listen to it on this [reel](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CelhKZkvQpQ/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==).
