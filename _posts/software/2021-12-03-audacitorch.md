I contributed a deep learning framework and a deep model manager that connects to HuggingFace to Audacity. This project was funded by a [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2021/projects/5097817919455232/) grant. Read the [Work Product Summary](https://www.audacityteam.org/gsoc-2021-work-product-source-separation-and-deep-learning-tools/). 

You can download Audacity with Deep Learning [here](https://interactiveaudiolab.github.io/project/audacity.html). 

Take a look at the [code](https://github.com/audacitorch/audacitorch).
