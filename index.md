##### about me

I was born and raised in Honduras but came to the US to pursue a degree in electrical engineering.

My goal is perform research in audio, music, and interactive musical systems to build and design tools that make music more accessible to people around the world as well as provide artists with innovative compositional tools.  

I'm currently a doctoral student in the [Interactive Audio Lab](https://interactiveaudiolab.github.io) at Northwestern University.
