##### Hello!

My name is Hugo Flores García. Born and raised in Honduras, I’m a doctoral student at Northwestern University working under [Bryan Pardo](http://www.bryanpardo.com/) in the [Interactive Audio Lab](https://interactiveaudiolab.github.io). My research interests include sound event detection, audio source separation, and designing accessible music production and creation interfaces. In my spare time, I enjoy playing jazz and funk guitar, writing interactive electronic music, as well as designing my own guitar pedals and effects, either physically or on SuperCollider.
